## LeetCode Java Solutions
GitHub: **[https://github.com/mborhi/LeetCode-Java-Solutions](https://github.com/mborhi/LeetCode-Java-Solutions)**

This project showcases my solutions to LeetCode problems. It includes detailed explanation about the algorithms and data structures used, and complexity analysis.

### Skills Applied
Continually working on this project has allowed me to apply and further expand the skills I learned in my Data Structures class. So far, I have used Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Priority Queues, Heaps, Memo-tables, Lists, and Hash Tables. Using these data structures, I used algorithm's such as Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Levenshtein Edit Distance, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Outside of this, I had to critically think to determine what is the best approach to solving a problem.

### What I Learned
Over the course of developing this repository, I have greatly improved my critical thinking skills. Additionally, I learned how to work better and more efficiently in a timed environment.

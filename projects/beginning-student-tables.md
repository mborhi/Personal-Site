# BSL Beginning Student Tables

A tool for writing programs systematically using check-expects (unit tests) in the Beginning Student Language.
With the Table Tool, you can write check-expects, test out different formulas, and export a combined program. The tool fully supports structure and constant definitions, pseudo-recursion, and check-expect imports.

## Development
This was developed with the supervision of **[Professor Chung-chieh Shan](https://cs.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Chung-chieh_Shan)** through my **[CSCI-Y 390 Independent Software Development](/academics)** course. This consisted of implementing and designing new features and improving usability of a previous iteration of the Table Tool.

My _contributions_ to the project includes:
* -Refactoring codebase to TypeScript and used with React.js to develop UI components 
* -Building parts of a Beginning Student Language compiler and parser using JavaScript to allow students to quickly import Beginning Student Language code
* -Front-end improvements, such table row dragging, image enlargement, and greater accessibility to the recursion feature
* -Using Jest to unit test and component test the application

For more information, please see the **[README.md](https://github.com/mborhi/Beginning-Student-Tables#readme)** of the project.

## Skills Used
* _Quick Learning_: I learned JavaScript and React.js, learned the codebase, and started developing in under a month.
* _Communication_: Completed weekly check-ins with my professor to discuss new features, and project direction, to ensure a good product.
* _Technical_: In addition to JavaScript/TypeScript and React.js, I used development tools such as Git.

## Testing
I used Jest to unit test and component test my application. More specifically, for the parsing and interpreting features, I used Test Driven Development to quickly and efficiently develop working programs. Using a TDD approach was especially important since the tool was actively used by students to complete course assignments for an introductory computer science class. Extensively testing in this fashion, ensured that none of the changes being rolled out had any bugs, and worked as expected.

# Personal Site

Built using Next.js with TypeScript and ChakraUI, tested with Jest and Storybook. This serves to display my skills, experience, and my academic record, as well as some cool sorting visualizations.

## Development

As a starting point I made a bullet point list on what I wanted to include on the website, as well as a simple wireframe drawing for how it should be designed. To implement the intended features of the site, I used _Test Driven Development_ principles to come up with design that allows for easy modification of the website's content. Storing the contents of pages which are subject to change in files separates the issue of presenting and styling it, and handling website interaction. This simultaneously made it easier to test the website, as utilities for parsing file contents, and components displaying these can each be unit tested efficiently. 

## What I Learned

Making this website I learned a lot about web development and design. Specifically, that there are _many_ ways to do the same thing, and often times the quickest or the most complex is not the best. Having a great understanding of the technologies and software development is important as it allow for choosing the right tools for the task.

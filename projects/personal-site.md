# Personal Site

Built using Next.js with TypeScript and ChakraUI, tested with Jest and Storybook

## Development

This was a great learning expereince on web development. Before making this site, I knew close to nothing about making full-stack web dev. As I learned, there are ***many*** ways to do the same thing.

## Testing

To ensure that everything... I used Jest for Unit testing specifically for the visualizaion testing, and Storybook for component testing. Using **Test Driven Development** helped me a lot in getting a final product out.

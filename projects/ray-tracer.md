# Minimal Ray Tracer

***This project is currently under development, but will be complete soon!***

A Java application using backward raytracing to produce images.

### Development

Here are some of the resources that I am currently using to develop this project:
* YouTube -- UC Davis Academics: **[Ray Tracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahp6LDQnK4Y)**
* Ohio State University: **[Ray Tracing Basics](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~shen.94/681/Site/Slides_files/basic_algo.pdf)**

### Testing
Unit testing all mathematic formulas using JUnit.

### What I Learned

This project has greatly helped me in my understanding of computer graphics, algorithm time complexities, and linear algebra.
